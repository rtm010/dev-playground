# Dev Playground

Welcome to my dev playground, an equivalent of my [data playground](https://github.com/rtm010/data-playground), but for my non-data itch. 
Here I'll focus more on exploring and learning about software development topics because, aside from being curious, I believe this will help improve my skills as a data analytics professional.

## Projects
**1. [A simple project management app](https://github.com/rtm010/dev-playground/tree/master/simple-project-management-app)**  
In this project I explore the world of full stack web development, starting off with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/), an excellent combination for rapidly prototyping frontends.
The backend for this app will be added soon.
